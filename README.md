# Akira_Ransomware_IOC
Akira ransomware is a double-extortion ransomware strain that encrypts victim files and threatens to leak stoeln data unless a ransom is paid. It often targets corporate environments using tools like AnyDesk, Rclone and Veeam for lateral movement, exfiltration and persistence, with recent variants including advanced obfuscation and evasion techniques.
